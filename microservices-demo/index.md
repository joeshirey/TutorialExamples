# Tutorial: microservices-demo

This project is a demonstration *online shop* built using a **microservices architecture**.
It shows how different parts of an online store (like the *frontend website*, *shopping cart*, and *checkout process*) can be run as separate, small applications.
These applications, called microservices, talk to each other using **gRPC** (a fast communication method) and are designed to be run and managed on **Kubernetes**.
Tools like *Helm*, *Kustomize*, and *Skaffold* help package, customize, and automate the deployment of these services.
